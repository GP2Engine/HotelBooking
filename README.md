# HotelBooking

A dynamic website for Hotel Booking and Hotel Management based on [mrzulkarnine's](https://github.com/mrzulkarnine) initial project and worked on in collaboration with [billz96](https://github.com/billz96).

The HotelBooking website maintains the vast majority of the initial functionality and features changes such as:

* Login and Register functions
* Google Account Log In
* More secure admin accounts (fixes in some session tokens)
* State Arrival functions
* Fixed multiple errors (some related to compatibility)
* Facelifted UI + colors based on [Adobe's most popular colors of the month](https://color.adobe.com/explore/?filter=most-popular&time=month)
* Added account management capabilities for administrators
